Book Review Haiku

This is an app to store a list of your favorite books with reviews in the form of Haikus for each book.

1. Create a Sinatra app that reads from/writes to a .erb file
2. The .erb file should include a form to enter a new book
 - the form should have a text input field for title, author, and a block input field for the haiku
3. The .erb file should list your books and haiku reviews
4. The list of reviews should persist, so you will need a database! There is only one table required, Books. This table should have 3 fields: Title, Author, and Review

Bonus items! 
* WARNING: do not attempt any of these at 12am!!! Instead GO TO BED! <stern face of Oz>

5. Each book title will include a link to the Google books API description of the book
6. Your app has a pretty sweet user interface so it's beautiful and fun to use â˜º
